## **Oral Presentation Guidelines**

The goal of the oral presentation is for you to teach the class (including your instructors) about your topic. This will depend on the class size, but oral presentations are typically 30 minutes with a few interruptions for questions and clarification, followed by 5–10 minutes for questions and discussion period. _Three days before your presentation_ send the instructor's assistant a one paragraph abstract to be shared with the class. Include a reference to a review article and a recent research paper or paper you consider to be seminal. Your instructors and fellow students will look these over before class so they can think about your topic in advance and formulate better questions for discussion.

_Also before your presentation_, preferably, 5 to 6 days, and at the very least 2 days before, you will practice your talks to one or more of the people scheduled to present that same day. You will write a brief description of your suggestions for improvement of the oral presentation of your team and this will be emailed to the instructor on the day of your group's presentations. It might be as brief as: "Jenny is an accomplished public speaker and gave a very well organized presentation. I suggested that she define her terms, and explain some concepts in the initial part of the talk." More likely it will include more specifics. For example:

"Josh has had little practice in public speaking. I suggested that he simplify his slides, and taught him how to use animation in Powerpoint to layer information more effectively. I suggested that he begin with a very general description of pathology, but he felt that would be too boring. He may be right. I also suggested that he provide a handout for medical terminology, for future reference. His slides on amyloid in the CNS and its correlation with disease were very difficult to see. I suggested he find better illustrations."

For your talk, use Powerpoints or other visual aids to illustrate key points. The general format:

- first a broad overview of the problem and its importance,
- pose the questions,
- describe key experiments,
- critically analyze and interpret the results,
- present an eye to the future.

You can't cover everything that will appear in your final paper. The class presentation should be specifically constructed and tuned for an oral presentation. As in a professional presentation, your talk will be rehearsed and timed beforehand, with input from a peer reviewer in the class.

## **Final Paper Guidelines**

The final papers are due the last week of classes. The format of the final papers should be a mini review of the selected topic. At the point you have completed the paper, you should be an expert on the subject, with the additional good feeling of having made your understanding available to your classmates and instructors during your oral presentation. The listed references are intended only to be starting points. You are responsible for finding the latest relevant results, using the tools built in to modern journal online resources. Just as with a scientific publication, the paper should be a single coherent integrated text.

The text should begin with an _Introduction_ that gives the background and general context of the work, including the societal and biomedical importance. This is to be followed by a _Critical Results and Discussion_ section that reviews the findings that you consider most relevant and important. Try to follow the format of first posing the question; then describing the experiment designed to answer the question; finally analyzing the resulting data. Reproduce a few figures to illustrate aspects of the subject. The paper should consist of a title page with an Abstract (\<250 words) of the most important results and conclusions. The text proper should be 12–16 double spaced pages, with 16 pages the absolute limit. References and figures are additional. The references should include the full titles of the papers. The target audience is the other students in the class and your instructors.

One full week before the paper is due you will exchange drafts with the other members of your team.You will provide editorial suggestions—not just copy editing but substantive feedback on things that are unclear, things that are missing, things that are given too much space for their import, etc. Make a photocopy of your comments on your colleague's paper and hand them in with the final paper. They are an important part of your class participation.

## **Student Presentation Topics**

The references listed are to get you started. They do not represent a complete or systematic sampling of the literature. Finding, reading and assimilating a subset of critical papers is your responsibility.

The Refolding Pathway for Apomyoglobin
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Hemoglobin is one of the paradigms for a protein whose conformation controls critical physiological processes, and whose malfunction leads to a variety of anemias. Hydrogen exchange and NMR have been used to identify intermediates in the refolding of apomyoglobin. This allows interpretation of a variety of human hemoglobin.

HSP90 A&B
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

This chaperone is specialized for the maturation of metastable proteins that often play key roles in cell circuitry, such as transcription factors, kinas, phosphatases. It cooperates with a host of other co-chaperones. To recognize its targets, it is expressed at high levels in all eukaryotic cells and is induced by many types of stress. It is an exciting new target for cancer therapeutics.

The SecB Chaperonins in Proteins Destined for Export
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}
A number of proteins destined for export (and perhaps folding) outside the cell must be maintained in a non-folded state after synthesis. Some of those are maintained in this state by the secB protein of E.coli, whose mechanism has been studied in considerable detail. (Linda Randall and coworkers).

Chaperonin Function in Bacterial Pilus Assembly
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Bacteria use extra cellular flagella and pili for swimming, attaching to other cells and transporting DNA. The folding and assembly of the proteins for these organelles utilize specialized chaperonins, some of which function in the bacterial periplasm. These function both in chain folding and in polymerization of the extracellular pilus organelle.

Prions are a diverse group of unrelated proteins that have very unusual folding properties. They can exist stably in profoundly different conformations, one of which (the prion conformation) can template other proteins of the same type to change into the prion conformation. This creates a protein conformational chain reaction that can cause terrible diseases, or serve as an epigenetic mechanism for the inheritance of new traits. (Prusiner, Lansbury).

Therapeutic Approaches to Retarding or Alleviating Alzheimers (refs. to follow)

Therapeutic strategies for alleviating Alzheimers disease cover a vast landscape. They include, among others: attempts to reduce the production of ABeta by inhibiting a protease that cleaves APP, immunizing patients against ABeta, protecting mitochondrial function, providing nerve growth factors, and blocking amyloid assembly. Provide an overview, and then choose three strategies and report on them in detail. The rationale, evidence of success, reasons they might fail.
